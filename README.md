### Usage

Add the following to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
ihex = "1.1"
```

In addition, and this to your crate root:

```rust
extern crate ihex;
```

Here is an example which builds an IHEX object file with test data and prints it:


```rust
extern crate ihex;

use ihex::record::Record;
use ihex::writer;

fn main() {
    let records = &[
        Record::Data { offset: 0x0010, value: vec![0x48,0x65,0x6C,0x6C,0x6F] },
        Record::EndOfFile
    ];

    if let Ok(object) = writer::create_object_file_representation(records) {
        println!("{}", object);
    }
}
```
